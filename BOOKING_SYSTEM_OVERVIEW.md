# Booking System Overview

## **What "Adding Route to Cars Page and Coupon" Means:**

### **🚗 Cars Page Integration:**
**Before:** Cars listing page only showed car information with "Rent Now" links that went to individual car pages
**After:** Cars listing page now has "Book Now" buttons that open a booking modal directly

**After:** Coupons can be applied during the booking process with real-time validation
