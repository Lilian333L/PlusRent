-always test before pushing to github or to production.
-don't make assumptions and test thorough before implementing changes.
-check for curly braces before finishing file changes.
-don't forger that we're using vercel dev to run project
-always make separate file for css and javascript, don't mess HTML, JS and CSS. Each should have a separate file for reusability.
-always remove test files when tests are finished
-always add follow up questions if the instructions are not clear
-don't push without prior testing
-don't remove from DB without prior permission
-if i ask a questions, its not neccesarrily to start implementation, ask permission if i didn't provided clear instructions that changes should be done
-the perfect scenario will be for you to make a reserve file copy before changing it, and if tests passed, keep to latest one
- Create a "TODO.md" file with current tasks and context
- Use "CONTEXT.md" files in folders to explain what each directory does
- Add "SETUP.md" with environment setup steps
- Create "DEBUG.md" with common issues and solutions
- Add more comments so its clear how code works
- Create "ai-memory.md" to remember what worked/didn't work
- never do commits, pushes and anything related to gitbup except when I specifically ask you to
- when I say "Do changes" at the beginning, only then you are to do the changes. This is valid for every message I send you. If I don't write you "do changes", you are just to investigate or check
